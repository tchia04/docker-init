docker init

Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.Docker.md

Let's get started!

? What application platform does your project use? Rust
? What version of Rust do you want to use? 1.71.0
? What port does your server listen on? 7878

CREATED: .dockerignore
CREATED: Dockerfile
CREATED: compose.yaml
CREATED: README.Docker.md

âœ” Your Docker files are ready!

Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.

WARNING: Cargo.lock was not found but is required to run your application. You can create it by running cargo generate-lockfile

When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build

Your application will be available at http://localhost:7878

Consult README.Docker.md for more information about using the generated files.
