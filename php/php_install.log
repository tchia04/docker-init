$ docker init

Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:
  - .dockerignore
  - Dockerfile
  - compose.yaml
  - README.Docker.md

Let's get started!

? What application platform does your project use? PHP with Apache
? What version of PHP do you want to use? 8.2.13
? What's the relative directory (with a leading .) for your app? other
? Please enter the relative directory (with a leading .) for your app: ./
? What local port do you want to use to access your server? 9898

CREATED: .dockerignore
CREATED: Dockerfile
CREATED: compose.yaml
CREATED: README.Docker.md

âœ” Your Docker files are ready!

Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.

If your application requires specific PHP extensions, you can follow the instructions in the Dockerfile to add them.

When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build

Your application will be available at http://localhost:9898

Consult README.Docker.md for more information about using the generated files.
